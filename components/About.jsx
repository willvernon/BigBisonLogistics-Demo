					While the Founder of Big Bison Logistics has over 20 years of

				<p>
					Every team member is personally vetted by the founder before they
					are trained by our team to ensure new teammates have values
					aligned with ours; Integrity, Morals, Flexibility, and Extreme
					Ownership are building blocks of our culture of service to
					others.{' '}
